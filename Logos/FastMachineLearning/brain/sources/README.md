# Fast Machine Learning Lab "Brain" Logo Sources
The FastML "Brain" logo consists of two primary elements, the "brain" and the "event display". 

## "Brain" Source
The "Brain" portion of the logo is, as best found, created by user ["Seanbatty" on Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/illustrations/artificial-intelligence-ai-robot-2228610/), and is used under [Pixabay's "Content License"](https://pixabay.com/service/terms/)

## "Event Display" Source
The Event Display portion of the logo is originally from CERN: [CMS collision events at 7 TeV: candidate ZZ to 4e](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1378102?ln=en), specifically "CMS-PHO-EVENTS-2011-008-6". The version used here is a slightly modified version of that.
